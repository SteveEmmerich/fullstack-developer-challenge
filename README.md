The following exercise is to gauge the developerâ€™s expertise in the various technology components used to create software at Bellese Technologies. 

## What will you do

Manage your trainer and their roster of pokemon through a mobile ready interface. 

## What are the functional requirement

1. View trainer data
    1. Edit trainer age
    2. Use amplify for login and other trainer information
2. Lambda functions for CRUD opperations
3. RDS to hold the roster of pokemon and thier changes
    1. Add a pokemon to roster
    2. Remove a pokemon from roster
    3. Edit a pokemons nickname

## What technologies should you use
1. Ionic/Angular 8
2. AWS Amplify
3. AWS Lambda (Node)
4. AWS RDS (postgres)

## How this will be reviewed

This is in no way a pass/fail exercise. The reviewers will be looking at the overall solution, what technologies were used, and how those technologies were implemented. The reviewers will also be looking at aspects of the approach that include code cleanliness and pattern usage. The developer should demonstrate a solid understanding of how the components of a tech stack come together to produce a functioning web application.
