The following exercise is to gauge the developerâ€™s expertise in the various technology components used to create software at Bellese Technologies. 

## What will you do

Manage your trainer and their roster of pokemon through a mobile ready interface. 

## What are the functional requirement

1. View trainer data
    1. Edit trainer age
    2. Use amplify for login and other trainer information
2. Lambda functions for CRUD opperations
3. RDS to hold the roster of pokemon and thier changes
    1. Add a pokemon to roster
    2. Remove a pokemon from roster
    3. Edit a pokemons nickname
4. Search for pokemon in the "Pokedex" to add to roster.


## What technologies should you use
1. Ionic/Angular 8
2. AWS Amplify
3. AWS Lambda (Node)
4. AWS RDS (postgres)

## How far did I get
Untested, but I have most of the code complete. Amplify and the Login page where not working, and I have not implemented fetching the Poke Api.

I will submit what I have but continue to work on it.
